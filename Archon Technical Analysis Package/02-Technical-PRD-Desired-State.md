# Technical Product Requirements Document - Archon (Beta)

## Vision & Objectives

### Product Vision
To be the definitive command center for AI-assisted software development, providing a seamless, integrated environment for managing knowledge, context, and tasks. Archon will empower developers and AI coding assistants to collaborate effectively, leveraging a shared knowledge base to produce higher quality code faster.

### Success Metrics
The transition from Alpha to a stable Beta will be measured by:
- **Test Quality:** Backend test suite achieves >90% coverage with meaningful, strict assertions. Frontend test suite is re-enabled and maintains >90% coverage.
- **CI/CD Maturity:** The CI pipeline includes automated security scanning, and a Continuous Delivery pipeline is established for automated deployments to a staging environment.
- **System Stability:** A 99.9% uptime SLA is maintained on the production environment.
- **Security:** Zero critical or high-severity vulnerabilities are present in the codebase or its dependencies.
- **Developer Onboarding:** A new developer can set up their environment and have the application running locally in under 30 minutes using the official documentation.

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
The system shall continue to provide and enhance the core functionality established in the alpha:
1.  **Knowledge Management:**
    -   Ingest knowledge from various sources (web crawl, document upload).
    -   Process and chunk documents for efficient retrieval.
    -   Generate vector embeddings for semantic search.
    -   Provide advanced RAG capabilities (hybrid search, reranking).
2.  **AI Integration:**
    -   Expose a stable and versioned Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI clients.
    -   Provide a core set of tools for RAG, task management, and project operations.
    -   Support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama).
3.  **Project & Task Management:**
    -   Allow users to create and manage projects, features, and tasks.
    -   Integrate task management with the knowledge base.
    -   Provide real-time updates on task progress.

### Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement | Current State (Alpha) | Target State (Beta) | Priority |
|----------|-------------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Performance | API Response Time | Unmeasured | P95 < 200ms for core API endpoints | High |
| Scalability | Concurrent Users | Single-user focus | Designed for small teams (1-10 concurrent users) | Medium |
| Availability | Uptime SLA | N/A (local-only) | 99.9% for production environment | High |
| Security | SAST & Dependency Scanning | Not implemented | CI pipeline must include automated SAST and dependency vulnerability scans that block merges on critical findings. | Critical |
| Quality | Backend Test Assertions | Weak (accepts 500 errors) | Strict (asserts on specific status codes and response data) | Critical |
| Quality | Frontend Test CI | Disabled | Enabled and passing in CI pipeline | Critical |

### Technical Specifications

#### Backend Architecture
The existing microservice architecture is sound and should be maintained.
*   **API Specifications:** All public-facing APIs (especially the MCP) should be versioned (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) to ensure backward compatibility for clients. API documentation should be automatically generated from the code (e.g., via FastAPI's OpenAPI support) and published.
*   **Service Architecture:** Services should continue to communicate via HTTP. For inter-service communication, consider adding a lightweight service mesh or standardized client libraries to handle retries, timeouts, and circuit breaking automatically.

#### Frontend Architecture
The current architecture using React, TypeScript, and Vite is appropriate and should be continued.
*   **UI/UX Requirements:** The UI should remain clean and responsive. All user-facing operations should provide immediate feedback, using optimistic updates for a smoother experience where appropriate.
*   **Performance Requirements:** The frontend application should load in under 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection. Bundle size should be monitored and optimized to stay under 1MB.

#### Database Design
The use of Supabase with PostgreSQL and pgvector is appropriate.
*   **Schema Design:** All schema changes must be managed through version-controlled migration scripts. Direct changes to the database schema in any environment should be prohibited.
*   **Performance Requirements:** All common database queries should be analyzed and optimized. Ensure appropriate indexes are in place for all foreign keys and frequently queried columns.
*   **Backup Strategy:** A formal backup and recovery strategy must be implemented. Supabase provides automated backups, but a process for testing restores should be established. Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) should be enabled.

#### Infrastructure Requirements
*   **Deployment Architecture:** A formal Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline should be created.
    1.  On a successful merge to `main`, the CI pipeline should trigger a deployment to a **Staging** environment.
    2.  Automated smoke tests should run against the Staging environment.
    3.  Promotion to the **Production** environment should be a manual, one-click action after successful staging validation.
*   **Scaling Strategy:** For the Beta stage, the system can remain on a single-node Docker Compose setup. However, the infrastructure should be defined using Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform) to prepare for a future migration to a scalable platform like Kubernetes or a cloud provider's container service.
*   **Monitoring Requirements:**
    *   **Logging:** Centralized logging should be implemented for all services (e.g., using the ELK stack, Datadog, or Logfire, which is already in the dependencies).
    *   **Metrics:** Each service must expose key performance metrics (e.g., request rate, error rate, latency) in a Prometheus-compatible format.
    *   **Alerting:** An alerting system (e.g., PagerDuty, Opsgenie) should be configured to notify the team of critical issues, such as high error rates, service unavailability, or high resource usage.
