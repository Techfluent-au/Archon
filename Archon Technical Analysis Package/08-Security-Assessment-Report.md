# Archon - Security Assessment Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides an assessment of the current security posture of the Archon application. The assessment is based on a static analysis of the codebase, configuration files, and CI/CD pipeline.

Overall, Archon has a solid security foundation at the database level through the use of Row Level Security (RLS), but it has significant gaps in its application and infrastructure security practices. The project is in an alpha stage, and as it matures towards a production-ready state, addressing these gaps should be a top priority.

The most critical recommendations are to **implement automated security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline** and to **establish a formal process for managing secrets** in production environments.

## 2. Key Findings and Recommendations

### 2.1. CI/CD Security (Critical)

*   **Finding:** The current CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) does not include any automated security scanning steps.
*   **Risk:** This lack of automation means that security vulnerabilities can be introduced into the codebase without being detected. This includes both vulnerabilities in the application code itself and vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   **Recommendation:**
    1.  **Dependency Scanning:** Integrate a tool like **Trivy** or **Snyk** into the CI pipeline to scan all `package.json` and `requirements.txt` files for known vulnerabilities. The pipeline should fail if high or critical severity vulnerabilities are found.
    2.  **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate **GitHub CodeQL** into the CI pipeline. CodeQL can analyze the Python and TypeScript code to identify common security flaws like injection vulnerabilities, insecure configurations, and more.

### 2.2. Secret Management (High)

*   **Finding:** Secrets (e.g., `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) are managed via a local `.env` file for development. There is no defined strategy for managing secrets in a production environment.
*   **Risk:** Storing secrets in environment files is not secure for production. It increases the risk of accidental exposure, especially if the environment files are ever checked into source control or if access to the production server is compromised.
*   **Recommendation:** For production environments, adopt a dedicated secret management solution such as:
    *   **HashiCorp Vault**
    *   **AWS Secrets Manager**
    *   **Google Secret Manager**
    *   **Azure Key Vault**
    The application should be configured to fetch secrets from this service at startup rather than reading them from a file.

### 2.3. Database Security (Good)

*   **Finding:** The database schema makes excellent use of PostgreSQL's **Row Level Security (RLS)** feature. All tables have RLS enabled, with policies that grant appropriate access to different roles (`service_role`, `authenticated`).
*   **Risk:** The current policies are relatively simple. As the application grows to support multiple users or teams, these policies will need to be refined to ensure proper data isolation (tenancy).
*   **Recommendation:** The current RLS setup is a strong foundation. Continue to use and expand upon this pattern. As multi-tenancy becomes a requirement, update the RLS policies to be tenant-aware (e.g., `USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id'))`).

### 2.4. Application Security (Needs Improvement)

*   **Finding:** The backend API uses `slowapi` for rate limiting, which is good. However, there is no explicit mention or configuration for other common web application security headers or protections.
*   **Risk:** The application may be vulnerable to common web attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and clickjacking if not properly configured.
*   **Recommendation:**
    1.  **Security Headers:** Ensure that the FastAPI application is configured to send appropriate security headers, such as `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and `X-Content-Type-Options`.
    2.  **Input Validation:** Continue to rigorously use Pydantic for input validation on all API endpoints to prevent injection attacks and other data-related vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Authentication:** The authentication mechanism was not deeply analyzed, but it should be reviewed to ensure it follows best practices (e.g., using secure, short-lived tokens; protection against brute-force attacks).

## 3. Conclusion

The Archon project has a good foundation for database security but needs to mature significantly in its application and CI/CD security practices. The recommendations in this report provide a clear roadmap for hardening the application as it moves towards a beta or production release.
