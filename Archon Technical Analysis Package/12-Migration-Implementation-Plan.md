# Archon - Migration & Implementation Plan (Alpha to Beta)

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for migrating the Archon project from its current **Alpha** state to a stable **Beta** release. The plan is based on the findings from the technical analysis and the desired state defined in the `02-Technical-PRD-Desired-State.md`.

The migration is divided into three main pillars:
1.  **Quality Assurance Hardening**
2.  **Security Integration**
3.  **Infrastructure & DevOps Maturity**

## 2. Phase 1: Quality Assurance Hardening (Highest Priority)

The most critical step is to build a reliable quality assurance framework.

*   **Task 1: Strengthen Backend Test Assertions**
    *   **Objective:** Refactor the entire backend test suite in `python/tests/` to use strict, meaningful assertions.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   Tests must assert on specific HTTP status codes (e.g., `200`, `201`, `404`) and not accept `500` errors.
        *   Tests for successful operations (`POST`, `PUT`, `GET` on existing resources) must validate the structure and content of the response body.
        *   The "alpha philosophy" of failing fast should be moved from the tests to the application logic itself; the tests should be the stable specification of correct behavior.
*   **Task 2: Re-enable Frontend CI Tests**
    *   **Objective:** Re-enable the `frontend-tests` job in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` pipeline.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   All existing frontend tests in `archon-ui-main/test/` must pass.
        *   The CI pipeline must fail if any frontend test fails.
        *   The frontend linting (`eslint`) and type checking (`tsc`) steps must also be re-enabled and passing.

## 3. Phase 2: Security Integration

*   **Task 3: Integrate Automated Security Scanning**
    *   **Objective:** Add a new `security-scan` job to the CI pipeline.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The pipeline must scan for vulnerabilities in both NPM and Python dependencies (e.g., using Trivy).
        *   The pipeline must perform static analysis security testing (SAST) on the codebase (e.g., using CodeQL).
        *   The pipeline must be configured to fail and block PR merges if critical vulnerabilities are detected.
*   **Task 4: Define Production Secret Management Strategy**
    *   **Objective:** Choose and document a secret management solution for production (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The chosen solution is documented.
        *   The application code is refactored to fetch secrets from the chosen provider when in a `production` environment, instead of from `.env` files.

## 4. Phase 3: Infrastructure & DevOps Maturity

*   **Task 5: Implement Continuous Delivery (CD) to Staging**
    *   **Objective:** Create a new CD workflow that automatically deploys the application to a staging environment.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   On a successful merge to `main`, a new set of Docker images are built and pushed to a container registry.
        *   These images are automatically deployed to a staging environment that mirrors production.
        *   Automated smoke tests are run against the staging environment to verify the deployment's health.
*   **Task 6: Establish Production Deployment Process**
    *   **Objective:** Define the process for promoting a release from staging to production.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   The CD pipeline includes a manual approval gate for production deployments.
        *   A rollback plan is documented.
*   **Task 7: Implement Monitoring and Alerting**
    *   **Objective:** Set up centralized logging, metrics, and alerting.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   All services are configured to send structured logs to a central logging platform (e.g., Logfire).
        *   Services expose key performance metrics via a `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus format.
        *   Alerts are configured for critical events like high error rates or service unavailability.

By completing these three phases, the Archon project will have a solid foundation of quality, security, and operational maturity, making it ready for a successful Beta release.
